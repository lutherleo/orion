"""Item 1: CREATE-not-MERGE persist, with Python-side dedup that reproduces MERGE's collapse.

Token-free, Neo4j-free tests for the pure row-builders `persist._node_rows` and `persist._edge_rows`
and the query builders `_node_create`/`_edge_create`. The end-to-end graph parity (per-label node
counts, per-type edge counts, FLOWS_TO == 217/1075) is guarded by the @slow
test_stream_two_partition_persist_parity on real Neo4j; here we prove the collapse semantics that
make CREATE safe."""
