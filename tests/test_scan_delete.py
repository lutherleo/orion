"""Change 4: deleting / counting a scan touches only that scan's nodes, in bounded batches.

Before: persist._clear, GraphDB.clear_scan, GraphDB.node_count and the runtime CLEAR_PROPS all
matched `(n {scan_id:$sid})` with no label -- an AllNodesScan over every scan in the database, in
one transaction. Now: one `MATCH (n:Label {scan_id:$sid})` per label, served by a scan_id index,
deleting LIMIT-sized batches until nothing is left. Live Neo4j, throwaway `test-<uuid>` scans.
