"""Task A: the standalone Joern->Neo4j builder.

Proves the build produces a correct, scan-isolated, file-attributed graph:
  - test_build_nodegoat        : real counts (CpgFile/CpgCall/FLOWS_TO > 0)
  - test_call_file_attribution : the eval() calls in contributions.js carry file_path (B3)
  - test_no_cross_scan_bleed   : every RESOLVES_TO edge stays within one scan (B2)

Builds a real NodeGoat graph, so it needs Neo4j up and the prebuilt cpg.bin fixture. Skips
cleanly when the DB is down. Not marked slow: joern-export from the prebuilt cpg.bin is ~3s.
