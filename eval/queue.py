"""Run queue. Every attempt is a row in `runs`; nothing is silently requeued.

Terminal statuses (ok|crashed|hung|error) are scored as they stand: a hung or crashed run is a
miss whose tokens count. The one exception is `aborted` (a subscription usage limit killed the
run, or the machine failed under an orion-lm run: Neo4j down or dropped, Joern missing -- eval.infra):
it is not the model's miss, is never scored, and gets a fresh attempt_no."""
