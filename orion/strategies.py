"""The discovery fleet's prompts, as data.

Each of the 4 shapes (from the validated PoC that hit 13/15 NodeGoat vulns at 0 false positives)

shape's specific instructions + a trailer telling the agent how to emit its structured leads.

separate trust boundary (it must not see the discovery transcript) and lives in its own module.

SCHEMA = """Schema-of-record (every node and every relationship carries `scan_id`):
  (:CpgFile      {scan_id, uid, file_path})
  (:CpgMethod    {scan_id, full_name, name, is_external, file_path, line, reachable_from_entry, hop_distance, centrality})

  (:CandidateFlow {scan_id, uid, source_uid, sink_uid, sink_category, path_uids, rank})
     -- PRECOMPUTED source->sink taint paths, ranked (rank 0 = best). source_uid/sink_uid are CpgCall
        uids; path_uids is a JSON array of the CpgCall uids along the flow; sink_category is the sink
        kind (code_exec/sql/nosql/redirect/...). Triage these FIRST (see shape A).
Edges (relationship properties also carry scan_id):
  (:CpgMethod)-[:CONTAINS_CALL]->(:CpgCall)
  (:CpgCall)-[:RESOLVES_TO]->(:CpgMethod)
  (:CpgMethod)-[:DEFINED_IN]->(:CpgFile)
  (:CpgCall)-[:FLOWS_TO {arg_index}]->(:CpgCall)      -- taint dataflow, reliable
  (:EntryPoint)-[:ENTERS_AT]->(:CpgMethod)
File attribution: use CpgCall.file_path (stamped on every call) -- do NOT rely on CONTAINS_CALL
alone, it is missing for calls nested inside arrow-functions assigned to object properties.
`code` on CpgCall is the raw source text of the call.

REACHABILITY (precomputed): `reachable_from_entry` (bool) and `hop_distance` (int; 0 = an entry
method itself, -1 = not reached) are stamped on every CpgMethod/CpgCall by a build-time BFS from the
:EntryPoint methods. A sink with `reachable_from_entry = false` usually cannot be driven by attacker
input. Treat this as a PRIORITY HINT, not a hard filter: the same arrow-function gap that breaks
CONTAINS_CALL can leave a genuinely reachable call marked unreachable, so never discard a lead on
`reachable_from_entry` alone.
CENTRALITY (precomputed): `centrality` (float 0-1) is the betweenness of the node in the reachable
call graph -- how many attacker paths funnel through it. A HIGH-centrality node is a chokepoint (a
shared sanitizer or a shared sink wrapper): a bug there has a large blast radius, so prioritize it.

ATTACKER-CONTROLLED SOURCES (framework-agnostic): a FLOWS_TO self-loop (src == dst) marks a call
whose own argument is already tainted by an untrusted input -- this is the fast way to find sources
regardless of language. Untrusted input enters at :EntryPoint methods (query
(:EntryPoint)-[:ENTERS_AT]->(:CpgMethod) -- their PARAMETERS are attacker-controlled). In a
JS/Express repo those sources surface as req.body.* / req.query.* field accesses; in another stack
they are the entry method's own parameters -- either way the FLOWS_TO self-loops and the EntryPoint
nodes point you at them without assuming a framework."""

_PREAMBLE = """You are a graph-querying security analyst investigating scan_id = "{scan_id}".

You have exactly two READ-ONLY tools:
  - mcp__orion__run_cypher(query, scan_id): run ONE Cypher query. ALWAYS filter with
    `scan_id:$scan_id` (or `WHERE x.scan_id = $scan_id`) in the query text, AND pass
    scan_id="{scan_id}" as the tool's scan_id argument on every call.
  - mcp__orion__semantic_search(query, scan_id, k): nearest code chunks to `query` by meaning, not
    structure -- useful when you don't know the right Cypher shape yet.

{schema}

GROUNDING RULE (non-negotiable): every claim you make MUST be backed by a query result you
actually ran this session. Never assert a vulnerability from memory, training data, or plausibility
alone -- if you have not queried for it, you cannot claim it. You are producing CANDIDATE LEADS,
never confirmed findings -- a separate, independent verifier (a different session, without your
transcript) will re-derive each lead from the graph and real source before anything is reported."""

    cf.sink_uid, cf.path_uids ORDER BY cf.rank
and for EACH, read the source + sink CpgCall.code (the uids are CpgCall.uid) and decide whether it is
a real vulnerable flow -- you are JUDGING concrete candidates, not exploring a graph. The path_uids
array is the tainted chain to inspect. Only after triaging the shortlist should you fall back to
walking FLOWS_TO by hand from the sources (the FLOWS_TO self-loops, and the parameters of
:EntryPoint methods) to catch flows the precompute missed; read CpgCall.code and look for a
template/query/exec/redirect/fetch/log call built from unsanitized input. A FLOWS_TO self-loop (src == dst) marks a call whose
own argument is already tainted by an untrusted input -- a fast, cheap place to start your sweep.
This is framework-agnostic: in a JS/Express app the sources look like req.body.*/req.query.*; in
another stack they are the entry method's parameters -- the self-loops and EntryPoint nodes find
them either way. Prefer calls with `reachable_from_entry = true` and low `hop_distance` (they sit on
a real attacker path); a sink no EntryPoint reaches is usually not exploitable -- but this is a
priority hint, not a filter (the arrow-function CONTAINS_CALL gap can mislabel reachable code), so
still look at an unreachable-but-dangerous sink, just rank it lower.""",

`executed = true` OVERRIDES a `reachable_from_entry = false` guess -- especially valuable exactly where
the static graph lies by omission (arrow-function/object-property calls, dynamic dispatch,
reflection). Query them, e.g.
  MATCH (a)-[r:OBSERVED_CALL {scan_id:$scan_id}]->(b) RETURN a.full_name, b.full_name, r.origin
and RAISE confidence on a lead a runtime fact corroborates. The grounding rule still holds (cite the
