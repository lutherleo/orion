"""The one additive writer for the runtime stage. The only impure DB module here.

Mirrors embed.py exactly: its OWN neo4j driver (not the read-only GraphDB), additive SET/CREATE, and
its OWN idempotent per-scan clear. It writes NO NODE_KEY label -- only `executed`/`hit_count` props on
existing CpgCall/CpgMethod nodes and a new OBSERVED_CALL edge between existing CpgMethod nodes. So
persist._clear (label-scoped to NODE_KEY.keys()) never touches it, and the static graph -- and its
217/1075 FLOWS_TO parity -- stays byte-for-byte identical.

`build_static_pairs` and the plan come from correlate.py (pure). Everything here is I/O.
