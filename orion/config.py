Orion runs its OWN Neo4j (see docker-compose.yml) on ports 7688/7475 — it does NOT use

# agentic coding requests puts the p90 near ~384s (avg ~258s) -- so the old flat 180s sat BELOW the
# average and silently killed thorough sweeps mid-turn on large graphs (empirically: 5 timeouts on
# the ~80k-node sharpemu scan; small validated repos like NodeGoat finish well under it). Discovery
# now floors at DISCOVER_TIMEOUT (>= p90 and a full MAX_TURNS budget) and grows with graph size,
# because a bigger graph is a bigger search space (more queries, more turns to triage), capped so a
# stuck agent still dies. The per-node slope is a heuristic anchored to one large-repo data point
# (sharpemu ~80k nodes -> ~900s), not a measured law; override any of these via env if repos differ.
