"""`discover_lm`: the in-process Orion-LM discovery stage, signature-parallel to `discover.discover`.

Reads the scan's :CandidateFlow slices (orion.lm.slice), enriches each into a CodeCase (orion.lm.cases:
the sink's function plus source/caller/callee snippets from one RepoIndex built per scan), works them in
rank order in batches of `k` (DEFAULT_K = 1: one case per session), runs
one `prompter.run_session` per batch against an already-loaded model (`model.generate`), and maps the
model's final `leads` onto `contracts.Lead` (shape "LM") with `file/function/line/cwe/path` filled and
`source_uid`/`sink_uid` copied from the flow the lead names by `flow_id` -- so the shared structural
dedup (same key as `discover._dedup`) collapses two leads on one flow.

Rules this module is built around:
  * Never imports `claude_cli` (nor `orion.discover`, which imports it at module top -- `_dedup` is a
    copy of discover.py's with the same key, kept here so the lm package stays Claude-free).
  * A failure is an `error` event + zero leads for THAT batch; other batches still run, the scan never
    crashes and no lead is ever fabricated.
  * A lead whose `flow_id` is missing or not in its batch is attached to the batch's first flow and tagged
    with evidence starting "flow_id unresolved" -- never dropped silently.
  * Every prompter step goes to `on_step(step)` untouched (Task F3 logs them; `orion/` must not import
    `eval/`).

`_load_flows` and `_session` are module-level seams so the token-free test can stand in for Neo4j and
the model.
