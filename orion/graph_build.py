"""Build a code graph for a repo and persist it into Orion's own Neo4j, returning the scan_id.

Standalone (no sentryV2 dependency): repo -> Joern CPG (~/joern) -> canonical schema -> Orion's
Neo4j on 7688. Single-scan lifecycle — each build clears its own scan partition and reloads, so
scans never accumulate or contaminate each other.

    scan_id = sha1(abspath(repo) + "|" + commit_sha_or_'nocommit')

is deterministic: the same repo at the same commit always resolves to the same scan_id (re-builds

    `language` pins the Joern frontend (jssrc/pythonsrc/gosrc/javasrc), overriding auto-detection;
    when omitted the frontend is guessed from the repo's markers and -- if `on_event` is given and
    the repo is polyglot -- a 'warn' event names the pick and the --language override.

    `stream=True` takes the streaming per-function build (parse/reuse cpg.bin, NO whole-graph export;
    the per-function producer -> bounded consumer assembles the SAME envelope) instead of the legacy
    joern-export blob; `queue_size` bounds how many function segments the consumer decodes at once.
    `scan_id` overrides the deterministic identity so two builds of the SAME repo (e.g. a legacy vs a
    stream parity check) persist into DISTINCT partitions instead of clobbering each other.

    `mem_stats_path` is a stream-only diagnostic hook (Task 10): when set, the stream branch's
    `build_envelope` writes a measured peak-RSS breakdown JSON there. It is IGNORED on the legacy
    path (which has no bounded consumer to measure); passing it never changes the returned scan_id.

    `on_batch` (item 4) is an optional `Callable[[schema.Batch], None]` run CONCURRENTLY with persist
    on the freshly-normalized batch, so an independent batch consumer (the semantic index) overlaps
    the persist write and wall-clock trends toward max(persist, on_batch) instead of the sum. It must
    read the in-memory batch (not the persisted graph) and must not need persist to finish; persist's
    clear is label-scoped so it won't wipe what on_batch writes. It is best-effort: an exception in
    on_batch is reported via on_event and never aborts the build.

    `profile`, when given, is used instead of `profiles.select_profile(...)` for BOTH the taint-source
    model and the pathfind sink vocabulary (e.g. `profiles.with_lm_sinks(...)`); None keeps the
    auto-selected profile exactly as before. A non-default `profile` also gets its own scan_id (see
