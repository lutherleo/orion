"""Discovery fleet: fan out the 4 shapes (A/B/C/D) concurrently, each as ONE `claude -p` session
with real MCP tool-calling. Claude Code loops internally over `mcp__orion__run_cypher` as many
times as it wants within a shape; `--json-schema` forces its final answer into a leads array, so
there is no text-protocol parsing here anymore (see claude_cli.py for the old PoC's `CYPHER:`/
`FINAL:` loop, now gone).

Nothing here is a confirmed finding. Every Lead is a CANDIDATE that a separate verifier session
(Task D) must independently re-derive before it can be reported.

    didn't tag) keep the original `(shape, text[:80])` key. The two keyspaces are disjoint, so a

    `config.discover_timeout(node_count)` so large repos get proportionally longer sweeps.
