"""Read-only Neo4j access: the grounding tool.

Every agent claim has to be backed by a query result from here. Write keywords are blocked, so
an agent (discovery or verifier) can read the graph but never mutate it. This is the single tool
that keeps the agents honest: they must query for a vulnerability, not assert it.

The MCP server (orion/mcp_server.py) wraps `run_cypher` as the read-only tool the agents call.
The safety contract lives here: read only, scoped to one scan_id. `clear_scan` is the one write,
and it is NOT agent-reachable — only the harness calls it, at the start of a build.
