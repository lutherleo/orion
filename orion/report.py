"""Render the run: candidate leads with their independent verdicts, confirmed ones first.

Everything here is a LEAD plus a verdict, never a "trusted finding". That honesty is the point:
Orion surfaces evidence-backed candidates, and the verifier's decision is shown alongside each,
with BOTH the lead's own cited evidence and the verifier's independently-queried evidence in view.

Only needs `contracts` + stdlib (no discover/verify/embed/graph_build imports), so it can be
tested and used without any of the heavy/live pieces being up.
