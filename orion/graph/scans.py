"""Scan partitions in Neo4j: which labels a scan owns, deleting / counting them in batches, and the
per-scan record that says whether a partition is complete and how it was built.

Every Orion node carries `scan_id`, but a label-less `MATCH (n {scan_id:$sid})` can't use an index:
it plans as an AllNodesScan over every scan in the database (~1.2M nodes on the dev box) and the
old deletes ran it as ONE transaction. Here every lookup names its label, is served by a
single-property scan_id RANGE index (the composite NODE_KEY indexes lead with scan_id but Neo4j 5
does not use them for a scan_id-only predicate), and deletes go in LIMIT-sized batches, one
transaction each, until a batch comes back empty.

Which labels each caller deletes is deliberate:
  - persist._clear: NODE_KEY labels only. It spares the semantic-index :Chunk nodes (embed writes
    them concurrently with persist) and the scan's record.
  - GraphDB.clear_scan / gc: SCAN_LABELS, everything the scan owns.

The record is one `(:OrionScan {scan_id, commit, profile, orion_version, status, built_at, counts})`
node per scan. `graph_build.build` writes status "building" before persist clears the partition
and "complete" after persist returns, so a crashed build stays "building" and `--scan-id` refuses
it. `counts` is a JSON string (Neo4j properties can't hold maps). OrionScan is NOT a NODE_KEY label
(persist never writes or clears it) and GraphDB.schema() hides it, so get_schema is unchanged.
