"""Persist a `schema.Batch` into Orion's own Neo4j: single-scan clear-and-load.

The one write path in the build layer. It clears the scan partition (label-scoped -- see `_clear`),
then CREATEs all nodes and all edges (endpoints MATCHed by NODE_KEY) as bounded UNWIND CHUNKS fanned
across a small session pool (items 3 + 5): O(chunk) per-transaction state, incremental commits, and
disjoint chunks written in parallel, instead of the old single whole-graph transaction. Idempotent:
a re-build of the same scan_id clears then reloads identical data. The chunk/parallel split trades
the old atomic clear-and-load (see `persist` for the crash-window tradeoff).

CREATE, not MERGE (item 1): the partition is DETACH DELETEd first, so every node and edge in the
batch is brand-new -- MERGE's MATCH-then-CREATE is pure wasted work on guaranteed-new data, and
dropping it "practically halves the queries" (Neo4j bulk-update guidance). The two collapses MERGE
gave for free are reproduced in Python before the write so CREATE yields a byte-for-byte identical
graph: `_node_rows` dedups nodes by NODE_KEY (last-wins), and `_edge_rows` dedups non-FLOWS_TO edges
by endpoint pattern (last-wins). FLOWS_TO is never deduped: `collapse_flows` can legitimately emit
two flows between the same call pair that differ ONLY by `arg_index` (e.g. `sink(x, x)`), and both
must survive -- a relationship MERGE (whose pattern can't carry arg_index) would have dropped one,
which is exactly why FLOWS_TO was already CREATEd.

Not agent-reachable — agents read through GraphDB.run_cypher (writes blocked). Only the harness
build step calls this.
