"""Canonical CPG schema for Orion — the frozen 7-node / 5-edge subset, as plain data.

A trimmed fork of sentryV2's collector framework. It keeps the one thing a collector must never
improvise — the deterministic uid — but drops the whole schema.json validation universe: Orion
persists exactly the schema-of-record labels, so node identity (the MERGE key) lives here as a
small dict, not a loaded JSON schema.

`Batch` is the write buffer: `emit_node`/`emit_edge` stamp scan_id and accumulate records the
persist layer MERGEs. Keeping scan_id on BOTH edge endpoint keys is bug-fix B2 (see emit_edge).
