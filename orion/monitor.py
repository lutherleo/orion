"""Live progress log for a scan run.

Every `ProgressEvent` the pipeline emits is appended as one JSON line to
`<run_dir>/progress.jsonl`, so a run is watchable in real time (`orion scan --watch`) and
inspectable after the fact -- and stoppable: `tail` polls the file rather than blocking on a
socket/pipe, so a caller can end it cleanly (Ctrl-C, or by flipping the `stop` signal) without
tearing down the pipeline itself.

Only needs `contracts` + stdlib, so this module (and its tests) stay usable without Neo4j, the
`claude` CLI, or the embedding model being anywhere nearby.
