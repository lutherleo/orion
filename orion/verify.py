"""Independent verification: for each candidate lead, a FRESH `claude -p` session (its own
`--session-id`, its own transcript) re-derives the claim using the **fp-check** skill against the
REAL SOURCE and the code graph. It never sees the discovery transcript -- only the lead's own
text/evidence/scan_id. That separation is the TRUST INVARIANT: verification must not be the same
agent grading its own homework (see CLAUDE.md / orion-shared-context.md).

Design (locked in task-d-brief.md):
  - one `claude_cli.run_agent` call per lead, with a fresh uuid4 session_id
  - `system` = VERIFY_SYSTEM: general verifier instructions + the schema-of-record (not
    lead-specific, so it is identical prep across leads)
  - `message` = ONLY this lead's shape/text/evidence/confidence + scan_id -- nothing from
    discovery's session or reasoning
  - `json_schema` = VERDICT_SCHEMA, forcing the reply into {decision, reason, evidence}
  - `add_dir` = repo_path (sandboxes fp-check's source reading to the target repo)
  - `extra_allowed` = ("Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Task", "Skill") -- fp-check reads source and
    spawns its own subagents; still NO Write/Edit/Bash
  - a subprocess failure sentinel, or a reply missing/mangling `decision`, maps to Verdict
    decision="ERROR" -- NEVER a silent CONFIRM. A verifier that genuinely can't decide says
    INCONCLUSIVE itself; ERROR is reserved for "the call itself broke."

verify_all() verifies leads with BOUNDED CONCURRENCY (config.VERIFY_CONCURRENCY, default 4). Each
lead is still its own fully isolated fresh session -- the trust invariant is per-lead and unaffected
by running several at once -- but a semaphore caps how many verify in parallel so a large lead set
does not spawn an unbounded number of claude -p processes or trip API rate limits. Verification is
the run's wall-clock bottleneck (each lead is a whole session), so this is where parallelism pays
off. Results are returned in lead order regardless of completion order; set concurrency=1 for the
old strictly-sequential behavior.

reliable (calls nested in arrow-functions assigned to object properties get no edge). Because the
graph lies by omission this way, you MUST also read the real source under the added directory --
do not trust graph attribution alone.
RUNTIME (present only after `orion scan --runtime` or `orion trace`): `executed=true` / `hit_count`
on a CpgMethod/CpgCall is GROUND TRUTH that the node ran during a live drive -- it CONFIRMS
reachability even where `reachable_from_entry=false`. An OBSERVED_CALL / OBSERVED_DISPATCH edge or an
:ObservedMethod node is a real observed call or function the static graph may lack.
Absence of any of these proves nothing (fuzzing is incomplete); never REJECT a lead solely because
runtime did not reach it -- read the source."""

VERIFY_SYSTEM = """You are an INDEPENDENT security verifier, running in your own fresh session.
A candidate lead was produced by a SEPARATE analyst agent whose session and reasoning you cannot
see and MUST NOT trust -- you are not grading your own homework, you are re-deriving the claim
from scratch.

{schema}

Use the **fp-check skill** to verify the candidate lead you are given against the REAL SOURCE
(available under the added directory for this repo) and, where useful, the code graph via the
`mcp__orion__run_cypher` tool (pass scan_id = "{scan_id}" and filter every MATCH by
`scan_id:$scan_id`; unscoped queries are refused). Confirm or reject the lead
ONLY on evidence you gather yourself in this session -- never on the analyst's say-so.

Rules:
- If the supporting code/structure the lead describes is not actually present in the source or the
  graph, REJECT it.
- If you cannot gather enough evidence to decide either way, say INCONCLUSIVE -- do not guess.
- CONFIRM only when you have concrete, cited evidence (a file+line, a queried graph fact, or both).
- EXPLOITABILITY (reachability): if the lead's sink has `reachable_from_entry = false`, weigh that as
  evidence AGAINST exploitability and lean INCONCLUSIVE or REJECT -- but do NOT auto-REJECT on it
  alone. The graph under-links arrow-function calls, so a real reachable sink can be mislabeled
  unreachable; confirm the reach (or its absence) against the real source before you downgrade.

When you are done, output the final verdict as the required structured JSON with fields
`decision` (CONFIRM | REJECT | INCONCLUSIVE), `reason` (why, citing your own evidence), and
`evidence` (the specific file/line or query result you found)."""
